# Ethan Mlaker

Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ethan Mlaker, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in Cybersecurity, Digital Forensics and Incident Response, and I dabble in building websites and fun Python projects. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- My goals are to learn best practices with these programming languages to harden defenses and mitigate risks of attack.

## Technologies and Tools

- Proficiency: I wouldn't consider myself proficient yet, but I am a novice in HTML, CSS, and Python. I am a begginer in JS still.
- Skills: Basic Linux and Powershell skills.
